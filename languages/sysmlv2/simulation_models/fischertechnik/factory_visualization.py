        `Factory.instantiate_machine()` assigned it (see

        after the last `::` is what the model itself calls the part

        already does for `part_def_name`. `drawer.panel_label` (e.g.
        "Belt") is kept as a kind prefix so the machine's type is still
        visible at a glance. placementCoordinate is deliberately omitted:
        it's already conveyed by the machine's drawn position in the
        viewport.

        The live attribute lines and button row are both delegated to each
        machine's own `MachineVisualization` drawer (`panel_lines()`/
        `panel_buttons()`, `fischertechnik_parts_visualization/generic.py`)

        machine was a ConveyorBeltMachine (`machine.conveyorSensFeed`,
        `machine.pre_feed_position()`, ...), which would raise
        `AttributeError` the moment a different machine kind (e.g.
        VacuumGripperMachine) got registered. `selected_color`/
        `on_select_color` are threaded down to each drawer's own
        `panel_buttons()` rather than drawing a shared palette here --
        currently only `TokenProducerVisualization` uses them (its own
        color picker, scoped right above its Emit Token/Random Emit
        buttons, drawn via `draw_color_palette()`).

        Returns the (rect, callback) pairs for every button just drawn,
        the speed slider's own hit-rect, every input field's (field_key,
        hit_rect) pair (see panel_input_fields(), generic.py), the
        content's own max scroll offset, and the scrollbar thumb's hit-rect
        (or None when nothing overflows and no scrollbar was drawn) -- so
        the caller's event loop can hit-test all of them the same way,
        computed here in the same pass as the drawing so the clickable
        area can never drift out of sync with what's on screen.

        `scroll_offset` shifts every row up by that many pixels before
        drawing (rather than scrolling a pre-rendered surface), so hit-test
        rects for buttons/fields/the slider come out already in real
        on-screen coordinates -- no separate translation step needed by
        `run()`. Content is clipped to `panel_rect`'s vertical extent
        (`screen.set_clip`) while scrolled, so rows pushed above y=0 or
        below the panel's bottom by the offset don't leak into the
        viewport above/below it; the clip is lifted again before the
        scrollbar itself is drawn, since that lives in its own gutter
        beside `panel_rect` and doesn't need it.
