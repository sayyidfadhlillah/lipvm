# Farthest the arm can ever reach from center (fixed pipe + full extension)

# just wide: the arm's *drawing* is always along local +x before rotation,
# but rotEncoder (VacuumGripperMachine) can point the whole arm in any
# direction once rotated onto the composite -- a surface only tall enough
# for the base/tower (as it used to be, back when the arm never rotated
# independently) would clip the tip off-canvas the moment the arm swings
# toward vertical (e.g. 90/270 degrees), even though the horizontal resting
# angles look fine. Same "rotate the whole composite, then center-blit"
# trick ConveyorBeltVisualization uses to stay valid (pygame.transform.rotate
# preserves a surface's own center across rotation -- true regardless of
# what's drawn inside it, but only useful here because the origin (machine
# center) sits exactly at that surface center, which requires the surface
# to be symmetric around it).

class VacuumGripperVisualization(MachineVisualization):
    """Draws a VacuumGripperMachine as seen from directly above, in three
    parts: a base (the foot -- a metal plate at ground level), a tower
    (the mast rising from the base, which the arm pivots around and
    reaches out from -- a vertical column collapses to a rectangle/circle
    in a top-down view, since it doesn't itself rotate or extend), and an
    arm reaching out from the tower.

    The arm itself has two segments: a fixed pipe from center to
    DEFAULT_ARM_PIPE_LENGTH (structural housing, never moves), and an
    extendable rod beyond that whose length tracks armEncoder live, via
    arm_encoder_to_model_size() (movement_computation_model.py). The whole
    arm also swivels around the tower live, tracking rotEncoder via
    rot_encoder_to_degrees() -- a separate rotation stage from the
    machine's own placement (base/tower position, whole-composite
    rotation via placementCoordinate.degrees), since the arm's swivel is
    independent of where the machine itself sits/faces in the factory.

    No panel_input_fields()/panel_buttons() override -- both fall back
    to MachineVisualization's own "nothing" defaults. There used to be a
    "Target" (horizontal/rot) input row feeding "Pick"/"Place"/"Safe Pos"
    buttons that called pick()/place()/moveToSafePosition() directly;
    removed once they stopped being useful enough to keep around -- this
    machine's own behavior is already driven entirely by the SysML
    model's own `do`/`accept` behavior (vgr-cb-true-simulation.xmi's
    VGRMissionWith2CB), proven working end-to-end, so a manual panel
    control duplicating that isn't needed to exercise this machine kind
    anymore.
