class TokenDepoVisualization(MachineVisualization):
    """Draws a TokenDepoMachine from directly above: a square base
    housing, and TOKEN_RECEIVER_OFFSET model units to its right (the
    machine's own local +x axis, before rotation) the platform a token is
    placed on to be stored -- the same coordinate receiver_position()
    (token_depo.py) hands back, so the drawn receiver and wherever a
    token is actually placed can never drift apart.

    Composited on one local, unrotated surface first (base centered on
    the surface's own center) then rotated as a whole and blitted
    centered on the machine's actual placementCoordinate -- same "rotate
    the composite, then center-blit" trick ConveyorBeltVisualization/
    VacuumGripperVisualization/TokenProducerVisualization already use.
    The drawing itself is still just this static picture --
    TokenDepoMachine has no motion to animate (storeToken()/
    emptyReceiver() complete in the single tick they're dispatched on,
    see token_depo.py).

    No panel_buttons() override -- falls back to
    MachineVisualization.panel_buttons()'s own "no buttons" default.
    There used to be a manual "Place" button here (dropping a token
    directly via Factory.spawn_token(), bypassing this machine
    entirely), since nothing else in the simulation could deliver a
    token to the receiver yet. Removed once that stopped being useful
    enough to keep around -- until TokenProducerMachine/VGR are wired to
    actually hand a token off to this depo, there is currently no way to
    get a token onto the receiver from the UI at all.
