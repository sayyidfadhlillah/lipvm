class ConveyorBeltVisualization(MachineVisualization):
    """Draws a ConveyorBeltMachine as seen from directly above: guide
    rails along its long edges, a flat surface with tread ridges running
    across the direction of travel, and a colored band marking the feed
    sensor (where parts enter) and the swap sensor (where parts exit) at
    their actual model-coordinate positions -- FEED_TO_SWAP_LENGTH / 2
    from center, not the edges of the drawn belt, since BELT_WIDTH is
    drawn wider than that to also cover the overshoot zone (see
    CB_LENGTH) -- in the belt's own unrotated left/right frame, as
    opposed to a side-on silhouette, which would show the rollers as
    circular ends. Still a static picture (matches Milestone 1 scope).

    Composited on a local, unrotated surface first because pygame's draw
    primitives have no rotation argument; the finished belt is rotated as
    one image via pygame.transform.rotate and then blitted onto the
    screen, recentered on the belt's placement coordinate.

    Pulls its shared viewport constants/helper (`BELT_WIDTH`/`SCALE`/
    `_to_screen`/etc.) from `factory_visualization.py` rather than
    duplicating them -- safe against circular imports since
    `factory_visualization.py` never imports this module directly, only
    discovers it at runtime via `scan_for_subclasses(MachineVisualization)`
    (`registry.py`), by which point `factory_visualization.py` is already
    fully loaded.

    No panel_buttons() override -- falls back to
    MachineVisualization.panel_buttons()'s own "no buttons" default.
    There used to be "Pre"/"Feed"/"Swap"/"Post" buttons dropping a
    manual token at each sensor boundary; removed once they stopped
    being useful enough to keep around -- this machine's own movement
    (moveToSensor()/moveOut()/moveNbSteps()) is already driven entirely
    by the SysML model's own `do`/`accept when` behavior
    (vgr-cb-true-simulation.xmi's ConveyorBeltSimpleMission), proven
    working end-to-end, so a manual panel control duplicating that isn't
    needed to exercise this machine kind anymore.
