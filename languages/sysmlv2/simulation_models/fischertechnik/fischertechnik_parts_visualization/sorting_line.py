class SortingLineVisualization(MachineVisualization):
    """Draws a SortingLineMachine from directly above: the housing
    (SL_LENGTH x SL_WIDTH), a center conveyor strip running its full
    length (styled like ConveyorBeltVisualization's own belt surface, for
    visual consistency with the machine it's built from), a band marking
    the inbound sensor near the entrance, and one colored sort platform +
    piston rod pair per TokenColorKind -- all ejecting toward the same
    side (the surface's top edge in this class's own unrotated,
    pre-rotation frame) -- the mental model being a token rides the center
    belt and, color-sensor by color-sensor, gets pushed off into whichever
    platform matches it.

    The piston is drawn at rest, not mid-stroke: a fixed cylinder block
    (PISTON_CYLINDER_WIDTH_PX wide, sized from PISTON_WIDTH) sits inside
    the housing at the belt's own edge, with only a short rod stub
    (PISTON_RETRACTED_ROD_LENGTH_PX) poking out past the housing edge --
    a real pusher's rod only reaches all the way out to the platform for
    the instant it's actually pushing a token; drawing it permanently
    spanning that whole gap (an earlier version of this drawing did) read
    as a fixed bridge connecting belt and platform, not a piston at all.
    Drawn after (on top of) the platform fill so the platform stays
    visible as color around the cylinder/rod.

    Each of the four sensor locations (entry, blue, white, red) gets an
    equal quarter of SL_LENGTH as its own zone (_ZONE_LENGTH/_ZONE_OFFSETS)
    -- a platform's span *along* the belt is that zone's width, not
    PISTON_WIDTH, which instead sizes the piston's own cylinder block
    (capped at that same zone width -- see PISTON_CYLINDER_WIDTH_PX).
    SORTED_TOKEN_PLATFORM_WIDTH is still how far each platform extends
    *out* past the housing's edge. If any of these stop matching the real
    device, only the numbers above this class need to change.

    The entry sensor is the one exception: drawn at conveyor-belt scale
    (CB_SENSOR_WIDTH, same as ConveyorBeltVisualization's own FEED/SWAP
    bands) rather than filling its whole zone, since it's a point sensor,
    not an ejector needing a platform. The rest of its zone is left as
    plain belt -- a transport stretch a token rides over without belonging
    to any sensor, distinct from the three color stations that each claim
    their full zone.

    Static picture only -- the piston is always drawn retracted, with no
    mid-stroke push animation and no reading of sensor_SL_*/token state
    to change what's drawn. A diverted token still visually lands on its
    own platform regardless: every Token draws itself at its own live
    position (factory_visualization.py's _draw_token) no matter which
    machine owns it, so this class doesn't need to know or care where a
    token currently is. Composited on one local, unrotated surface first,
    then rotated as a whole and blitted centered on placementCoordinate
    -- same pattern ConveyorBeltVisualization/TokenDepoVisualization
    already use.
