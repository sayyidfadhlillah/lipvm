    ExecutableStateUsage's own `pending` mailbox -- not just the first
    match, since more than one usage (e.g. two independent missions) may
    each have their own transition waiting on the same event type, and
    with no real concurrency between them, each needs its own chance to
    evaluate its own guards against it before the event is gone. Whether a
    given usage actually reacts to it is entirely up to its own
    TransitionTriggerBySignal.evaluate() check (and the existing
    drop-and-log fallback for a pending item nothing matches) -- this
    function doesn't pre-filter who receives it.

    command.item_name is a bare declared name (e.g.
    "CBCommandSuccessEventMessage"), resolved here against
    `item_defs_table` via get_reference_by_name() -- mirrors how
    on_tick() used to do this same resolution on the simulation side
    before it moved here (see EVENT-QUEUE-DESIGN.md).

    command.source_qualified_name (the emitting part's qualified name, or
    None for a broadcast event) is wrapped into a Reference and carried
    on the EventOccurrence's own `source` field, so a `via`-qualified
    TransitionTriggerBySignal can later tell which part an event actually
    came from -- same reference_type tag _resolve_feature_reference()
    already uses for a PartUsage referent.
