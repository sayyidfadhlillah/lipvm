          scan_for_subclasses(Enum) is the same registry mechanism already

          ExecutableStateUsage is currently evaluating it -- a formal
          parameter's own qualified name (e.g. "...::conveyorBelt") is
          never itself a lookup key in any global table. So this branch
          is selected purely by `reference_type` -- whether `current` is
          usable is a separate question, handled *inside* the branch, not
          a precondition for entering it (otherwise a missing `current`
          would silently fall through to the unrelated catch-all below,
          reporting the wrong cause). It resolves against
          `current.arguments`, the same lookup AttributeReference.evaluate()

          name, which a caller (e.g. BinaryExpression) could otherwise
          compare against as if it were a real value.

          "PartInstantiation", e.g. conveyorBelt=cb1 -- confirmed by

          the actual registry record itself (e.g. the PartInstantiation),
          not just its qualified name -- these are absolute, globally
          registered names (cb1 is declared directly under package Main),
          so a flat table lookup is correct and doesn't depend on which
          instance is asking. Anything with neither a table entry nor

          moveToSensor`): resolves `target` (a "Parameter" reference, e.g.
          conveyorBelt) via ReferenceValue -- same resolution
          AttributeReference.evaluate() uses -- to the concrete
          PartInstantiation this is actually being performed on, then calls

          using `self.name` (e.g. "moveToSensor", the perform-action's own

          the ActionDefinition's name and not what's callable on the

        Argument values are resolved eagerly, via a plain Value.evaluate()

        2. The PartDef-contained occurrence's own bound arguments (e.g. if
           ConveyorBeltMachine's own `perform action moveToSensor :
           MoveToSensor { ... }` declaration bound something itself --
           no model does today, but the mechanism doesn't assume it won't).
        3. This specific call site's own bound arguments (e.g.
