    Used as `@operation`, calling the method captures its arguments and returns
    an Operation without running the body. The body only runs when the VM steps
    through that Operation.

    Used as `@operation(left=..., right=...)`, each keyword argument is an
    evaluator for a sub-expression: a callable with the same signature as 
    the decorated method. Those sub-expressions are evaluated lazily and their 
    results are injected as keyword arguments into the method body before it runs. 
    This makes it possible to write:

        @operation(
            left=lambda self, runtime: self.left.evaluate(runtime),
            right=lambda self, runtime: self.right.evaluate(runtime),
        )
        def evaluate(self, runtime, left=None, right=None):

    Because evaluators are called lazily at execution time, a hot-swap that
    replaces a sub-node before its evaluator runs will be picked up naturally.
